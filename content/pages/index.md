          Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by CD
          Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike
          Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the
          fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian
          Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by Gavin
          Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with a
          cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and
          terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s
          behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two must work
          together to separate from each other and save V's life.
