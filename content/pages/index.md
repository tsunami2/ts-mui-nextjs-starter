          Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing game developed by CD
          Projekt Red, and published by CD Projekt, and based on Mike
          Pondsmith's Cyberpunk tabletop game series. The plot is set in the
          fictional metropolis of Night City, California, within the dystopian
          Cyberpunk universe. The player assumes the role of V (voiced by Gavin
          Drea/Cherami Leigh), a mercenary who accidentally gets imbued with a
          cybernetic "bio-chip" containing an engram of legendary rockstar and
          terrorist Johnny Silverhand (voiced by Keanu Reeves). As Johnny’s
          behaviour and memories begin overwriting V’s own, the two must work
          together to separate from each other and save V's life.

          Ghost of Tsushima is a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Sucker
          Punch Productions and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. The
          player controls Jin Sakai, a samurai on a quest to protect Tsushima
          Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan. Jin must choose
          between following the warrior code to fight honorably, or using
          practical but dishonorable methods of repelling the Mongols with
          minimal casualties. The game features a large open world which can be
          explored either on foot or on horseback. When facing enemies, the
          player can choose to engage in a direct confrontation using Jin's
          katana or to become a legendary warrior known as "the Ghost" by using
          stealth tactics to assassinate opponents. A multiplayer mode titled
          Ghost of Tsushima: Legends was released in October 2020 and made
          available separately in September 2021.
